            I’ve worked across fintech, marketplaces, startups and EdTechs — mostly in high-risk, regulated environments where UX must balance compliance, conversion and trust. 
            Outside of design, I’m a musical theatre actress and tarot reader, which deeply influences how I think about experience, storytelling and emotion in products.

          <h2>Product, but make it theatre, lab and coven.</h2>
          <p class="section-intro">
            My practice lives at the intersection of rigorous discovery, clear communication and a bit of dramaturgy. I like to bring people into the process — not just the solution — so that decisions feel shared and grounded.

              <h3>Discovery as a continuous ritual</h3>
              <p>
                I treat discovery as an ongoing practice, not a phase. That means continuously talking to users, mapping signals and adjusting hypotheses — especially in environments where everything changes all the time.

                I use narrative, visuals and prototypes to help teams see the same picture — and feel the consequences of decisions. Cases, journeys and anti-cases are part of how I bring strategy down to earth.

              <p>
                I look at users, teams and stakeholders as humans with constraints and emotions, not just roles. My background in theatre and tarot shows up as empathy, presence and the ability to hold ambiguity with care.

                  <p>
                    Medway is an EdTech focused on helping Brazilian medical students pass residency exams — especially those in the final years of medical school (the internship). Medway Academy emerged as a bet to support students earlier in their journey, during the clinical cycle, and position the brand as a reference sooner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The idea: offer an experience tailored to the daily reality of clinical cycle students, using cases, flashcards, questions and videos — all stitched together into study paths that respected their time, energy and cognitive load.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This meant building a new product inside an organisation whose core structure, metrics and brand positioning were still strongly tied to the internship ICP.

                    We ran a structured discovery to deeply understand the pains, rhythms and goals of clinical cycle students. This included qualitative interviews, diary-like sessions and multiple rounds of concept testing with prototypes.

                    Even with a validated concept, strong user signals and a solid content engine, Medway Academy was sunsetted. The main reason: strategic focus and organisational constraints, not product quality.
